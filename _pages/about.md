Hi I'm Felix,

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

My work and research
======
For my first software company, I worked creating Windows interfases that automated and processed swift messages of all types (MT XXX) using C# and Microsoft SQL Server. I developed a multi layer Web Application and Web Service that connected to the watch list manager and is capable of screening customers, vessels, organizations, countries, etc. To decrease regulatory risk while complying with regulations. The technology used in the front-end was a mix of AJAX, Javascript, JQuery and Telerik UI. The back-end consisted in C# application procedures with mainly ADO.NET Datasets. The database used was SQL Server and was managed by LINQ. SVN Subversion was used as control version system. A traditional linear development methodology was used. Later in my 2nd Job, I was a developer engineer and was fixing bugs specifically for a telecommunication company. Agile was used as the software methodology and Tortoise SVN as the Subversion client. I was assigned to evaluate and implement the migration of Microsft SQL to Oracle in a commercial product.


My background and history
======

I received my Ph.D in Computer Science in 2021 thanks to a Scholarship granted by the UCD School of Computer Science. I obtained my Msc. in Computing and Security from the Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at King's College London also through a Scholarship. My BSE. was obtained in Quito at the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador. Prior to receiving my Masters I was working for over 5 years designing implementing and maintaining software for several financial and private entities. I have vast experience programming in Python, C#, Java, and C++, experience with relational and non-relational databases and passionate about information security topics, digital forensics, computer intrusion techniques such as SQL injection, poisoning, key loggers, trojans, backdoors, etc.
