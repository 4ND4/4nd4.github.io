Hi I'm Felix,


My work and research
======
For my first software company, I worked creating Windows interfases that automated and processed swift messages of all types (MT XXX) using VB6.0, C# and Microsoft SQL Server. I developed a multi-layer Web Application and Web Service that connected to the watch list manager and is capable of screening customers, vessels, organizations, countries, etc. To decrease regulatory risk while complying with regulations. The technology used in the front-end was a mix of AJAX, Javascript, JQuery and Telerik UI. The back-end consisted in C# application procedures with mainly ADO.NET Datasets. The database used was SQL Server and was managed by LINQ. Later in my 2nd Job, I was a developer engineer and was fixing bugs specifically for a telecommunications company. I was assigned to evaluate and implement the migration of Microsoft SQL to Oracle in a commercial product. We were once assigned to test a chat platform that was developed by a contractor. As I had a slightly different mindset as my peers, I was injecting code on the chat and was able to perform a denial of service attack. Later I offered them the correct solution to mitigate the problem. The main issue was that I was recently hired and seen as the new guy for which they felt uncomfortable and dismissed my advise. Another project which I was assigned was the migration of the traditional authentication system to a web service based authentication system. I found a sql injection vulnerability that compromised the whole business infrastructure and would have caused significant losses to the company. I reported the vulnerablity but it received little attention. Later the issue escalated and I was the one assigned to fix the security breach which I did with ease by sanitizing the inputs. In my last job in Ecuador, I was involved in ASP, C# and SQL Projects for the bank. An interesting fix was the implementation of Asymmetric Key Algorithms and Secure FTP in Microsoft SQL 2000 with stored procedures to mitigate some security issues.

I'm familiar with control version systems and several software methodologies ranging from traditional linear development, waterfall and Agile.

My background and history
======

I received my Ph.D in Computer Science in 2021 thanks to a Scholarship granted by the UCD School of Computer Science. I obtained my Msc. in Computing and Security from the Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at King's College London also through a Scholarship. My BSE. was obtained in Quito at the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador. Prior to receiving my Masters I was working for over 5 years designing implementing and maintaining software for several financial and private entities. I have vast experience programming in Python, C#, Java, and C++, experience with relational and non-relational databases and passionate about information security topics, digital forensics, computer intrusion techniques such as SQL injection, poisoning, key loggers, trojans, backdoors, etc.
