This traffic simulator is a group project aimed to build a traffic simulation software based on a Cellular Automaton Model. The simulator was developed in Java with a MVC architectural style. Several design patterns were used such as singleton, decorator, etc. Unit test were accomplished with JUnit. JavaFX was used as the UI framework. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/violetavk/LondonSW_trafficsimulator)
