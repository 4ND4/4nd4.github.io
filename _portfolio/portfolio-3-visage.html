VisAGe DCS is a web-based voting system aimed to label images with age and gender. The system created the VisAGe dataset. VisAGe DCS was based on Showoff that was written in Python using Flask. The frontend uses Bootstrap, jQuery and Swipebox. The backend consists of a MVC python application connected to MongoDB. 

The code is available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/4nd4/visage/">here</a>.
