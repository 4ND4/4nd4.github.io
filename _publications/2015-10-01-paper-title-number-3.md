excerpt: 'Automated facial age estimation has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Several applications relevant to digital forensic investigations include the identification of victims, suspects and missing children, and the decrease of investigatorsâ€™ exposure to psychologically impacting material. Nevertheless, due to the lack of accurately labelled age datasets, particularly for the underage age range, sufficient performance accuracy remains a major challenge in the field of age estimation. To address the problem, a novel regression-based model was created, Vec2UAge. FaceNet embeddings were extracted and used as feature vectors to train the model from the VisAGe and Selfie-FV datasets. A balanced, unbiased dataset was created for testing and validation. Data augmentation techniques were evaluated to further be used to expand the training dataset'
